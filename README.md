# web-scraping-challenge

In this activity, I was requested to identify HTML elements on 2 webpages and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. 
After the web-scraping, I used Pandas to perform the data analysis, answering the following questions, among others:

* Average temperature by month:

* Average pressure by month:

* How many terrestrial (earth) days are there in a Martian year?

* Scraped data transformed into a Pandas DataFrame:

id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
ls: the solar longitude
month: the Martian month
min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location
